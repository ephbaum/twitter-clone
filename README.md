# Twitter Clone

## A learning opportunity for Mikey

The goal of this project is to create a rudimentary clone of twitter using Laravel's basic toolset with Michael as he continues to learn more about how Software Engineering Works 

### The Story So Far...

We began by using Laravel's Sail [build tool](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/installation#laravel-and-docker) and added scaffolding for authentication using [Laravel Breeze](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/starter-kits#breeze-and-blade)

### What's next?

Mikey says: Make it so you can post a tweet question mark? Shrug guy? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
